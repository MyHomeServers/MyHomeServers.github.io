<h3>Welcome to my self hosting subpage</h3>
<br><br>
<p>Some of the services I currently host are pihole as a standalone service. I also am hosting a couple of apache servers through docker as well a nginx reverse proxy.</p>
<br><br>
<p>You are probably wondering why I self host if you have made it this far. My reason is simple. I use pihole to block ads and to not have to pay for an adblocker. I use docker to run apache containers and a minecraft server.</p>
